### ABOUT 👕 👗 👔
**Wardrobe Planner is our answer to the age old question: *What to wear?***


‘[According to the UN Environment Programme, the fast fashion industry is the second-biggest consumer of water and is responsible for about 10% of global carbon emissions - more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.](https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/)’ Its impact on the environment along with its poor record on human rights make it an industry we want to be part of the solution for. 

[A survey by TotalJobs.com](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/work-clothes-average-woman-four-months-lifetime-officewear-suits-skirts-jackets-dresses-fashion-a8090531.html
) found that women spend four months of their working life deciding what to wear and it’s something that all of us relate to.

The wardrobe browser project aims to help users organise their wardrobe, browse their clothes, and get outfit suggestions based on certain criteria.The goal of our team  was to create an application with a simple and easy-to-use interface that simplifies decision-making, at the same time still  allowing users to express their creativity and personal style.
The project also promotes sustainable fashion practices by enabling users to share their clothes with other users whom they can tag as ‘friends’ in the app.  This way, people can borrow clothes from each other, reducing the need to buy new items and contributing to limiting waste.
